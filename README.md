# Module2Challenge
This repository holds the module 2 challenge - a portfolio webpage that I can use to hold example pieces of work to help me succeed in potential interviews. 

I struggled a little on this one as I found aligning the various components on the page quite confusing (especially the images as they frequently moved out of position). I think the layout of the webpage looks good and I like how the header and nav buttons turned out. If I had more time I think I could resolve any conflicts.
